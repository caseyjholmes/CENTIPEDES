# Centipedes
Dual purpose Manual and CV controlled 1-100 Burst Generator and Master Clock Eurorack Module with PSI EITHER WAY power in 4HP.

The module utilizes a ATMEGA328P micrcontroller. The firmware is included before and after compile. You can program with arduino or AVRISPMKII or ebay clone.

Do not populate R19. You can if you want, but it's not necessary. 
Otherwise, this is a straight forward Eurorack format synthesizer module build. 

Enjoy!
