# Centipedes
Dual purpose Manual and CV controlled 1-100 Burst Generator and Master Clock Eurorack Module with PSI EITHER WAY power in 4HP.
The module utilizes a ATMEGA328P micrcontroller. The firmware is included before and after compile. You can program with arduino or AVRISPMKII or ebay clone.

Do not populate R19. You can if you want, but it's not necessary. 
Otherwise, this is a straight forward Eurorack format synthesizer module build. 

Enjoy!

5-22-2023 update
Centipedes will now be taking on four individual modes that work with the posted PCB. I will be posting four software routines for each. 
The first of which is a new Centipedes V3 Firmware. It will be uploaded today 5-22-23

There is now one mode for each software file set. No more easter eggs or hidden features. Each mode is stand alone face value. No menus or bugs.

Stay tuned for the three additonal firmware modes. As well as new panels to match the firmware modes.

The first software mode is posted above on this page. 
The second, "Centipedes Voltage Controlled Matser Clock", is available here:

The third mode, "Centipedes Gate Crasher", is SOON to be available here:
