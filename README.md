# Centipedes
Quad-purpose Manual and CV controlled 1-100 Burst Generator, Voltage Controlled Master Clock, Voltage Controlled Gate Crasher and Voltage Controlled Clock Mult/Divide Eurorack Module with PSI EITHER WAY power in 4HP.

The module utilizes a ATMEGA328P micrcontroller. The firmware is included before and after compile. You can program with arduino or AVRISPMKII or ebay clone.

Do not populate R19. You can if you want, but it's not necessary. 
Otherwise, this is a straight forward Eurorack format synthesizer module build. 

Enjoy!

5-22-2023 update
Centipedes will now be taking on four individual modes that work with the posted PCB. I will be posting four software routines for each. 
The first of which is a new Centipedes V3 Firmware. It will be uploaded today 5-22-23

There is now one mode for each software file set. No more easter eggs or hidden features. Each mode is stand alone face value. No menus or bugs.

Panels will be provided for each alternate software mode  

The first and updated software mode is NOW posted above on this page.                                                                             
The second, "Centipedes Voltage Controlled Matser Clock" and its associated front panel, is NOW available here:
